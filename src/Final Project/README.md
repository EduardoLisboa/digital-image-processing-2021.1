# Final Project

Final project for the 2021.1 Digital Image Processing class at Universidade Federal de Alagoas.

The objective is to replicate and propose an improvement to an original paper using the image processing techniques learned throught the semester.

Student: [Eduardo Antônio de Lucena Lisboa][git_lisboa]

The report can be found [here][report_link] or in the "Reports" folder in this repository.

An online working version of this project can be found [here][colab_link].
---
## Original paper
Original paper was obtained on [Papers With Code][pwc] and can be found [here][original_paper].

The original repository can be found [here][original_repository].

---
## Machine Learning Model
The model used was created and trained by me in the 2020.2 Deep Learning class and it's code can be found [here][repo_dl], and the model can be downloaded [here][drive_model].

---
## Folder structure
In order for the project to work properly, the folder structure must be as follows:
```
project
|   README.md
|   k_means.py
|   main.py
└── Contours Plots
|   | placeholder.txt
|
└── Model
|   | Model.h5
|
└── Plots
|   | placeholder.txt
|
└── images
    | 1.jpg
    | 2.jpg
    | ...
```
Your images that will be processed must go inside the "images" folder.

Obs.: These _placeholder.txt_ files are as the names suggests, just placeholders so the empty folders don't get removed when uploading to GitHub, they can be deleted.
